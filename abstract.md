Climate Change is impacting all aspects of our lives. Even if majority indicators of changes in our life due to climate change might have been subtle so far, the impacts are going to be more pronounced in the upcoming decades in the form of a possible food crisis, if not tackled effectively. The term climate change is a broad blanket of various indicators and it is necessary to examine these specific indicators and their impacts on a global scale that is beyond just the surface level. Through this project, I have looked at climate change simulation data where related factors such as temperature, latitude, longitude, agricultural practices (Fertiliser,Irrigation,etc.) play a part in impacting the yield of crops across time. Analyzing past data and future data obtained through simulation, could help with determining certain trends which can then be used to come up with key steps to tackle the problem at hand. It is imperative for us to determine not just the factors but the extent to which these factors have impacted crop production over the years. Using ML models this project tries to look at the climate change impact on crop yield of four major crops and make inferences with regards to the findings of this study.
